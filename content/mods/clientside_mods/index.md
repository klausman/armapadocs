Here's a list of client-side addons that may prove useful. They are entirely
optional and may improve or worsen your gameplay experience.

The [Swifty 3 setup document](../../swifty/swifty3/#external-addons) has a section on
how to load external addons.

### Editing & Zeusing

- [3DEN Better
  Inventory:](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1124993203)
  A much nicer way of interacting with car/box/... inventories
- [3DEN
  Enhanced:](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=623475643)
  Many, many improvements for 3DEN, If you only install one mod for
  editing missions, it should be this one
- ~~[dzn Zeus Search
  Patch:](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1557429895)
  Instead of doing the search-as-you-type thing, this only searches
  after you hit enter, which makes the entire experience much nicer,
  especially in the larger categories.~~ Achilles now does this natively.
- [ZEI - Zeus and Eden
  Interiors:](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1251859358)
  Autofill buildings and objects like tables and shelves with random
  clutter.
- [Zeus Enhanced (ZEN)](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1779063631) An alternative to Achilles that has higher code quality/documentation and is actively maintained. **Do not use this and Achilles at the same time.**
- Composition packs:
  - [Custom Zeus Compositions](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=290561080)
  - [Darth Potato's Building Compositions](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1233323201)

  - [ZECCUP - Zeus and Eden Compositions for CUP Terrains](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=750186990)

NOTE: These almost always cause [spurious
dependencies](mission_depfix.html), so deactivate them when editing
missions!

- [JSRS](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=861133494)

  instead of the inventory screen.
- [ACE Interaction Menu

  only in the scroll menu.
- [Auto Weapon
  Lower](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1612623122)
  Automatically lowers your weapon in certain situations, helping to
  conserve stamina. Can bit a bit annoying at times, YMMV.

  Enhanced](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1623498241)
  Improves the capabilities of turrets on both vanilla and addon UAVs, Planes &
  Helicopters. Including adding markers on the spot the turret looks at,
  displaying grid coords of the current target, slewing the turrent to map
  locations or grid references, measuring distance and bearing between two
  points and assorted other quality-of-life improvements.

  Presence](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1326839989)
  Shows more info in your Discord status, like the mission you're
  playing.

  Hearing](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1240323575)
  Allows you to bind a key to lower the environmental sound volume (e.g.
  in helis)..~~ This can now be done with ACE3 itself.
